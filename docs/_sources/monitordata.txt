ics_sps_engineering_monitorData is a monitoring tools which gives a global view of all Camera unit status.

In this guide, You will be shown how to configure it properly and its differents functionalities will be detailed.

How to run ?
************

**First**, If you're planning to begin a real-time data monitoring, please be sure that :

 * Tron is started

 * Ics_archiver is running

Launch the following command from a terminal :

 **python main.py ip_database port_database**

 Example : *python main.py 10.1.1.1 5432*

By default if arguments are not provided :

 * ip_database : *localhost*

 * port_database : *5432*

Main scren
**********


Once you start, you can see the main screen with its differents widgets

It displays every status of the Camera unit with its matching timestamp.

Time out
========

.. image:: _static/timeout.png

This label has two states :

 * **ACQUISITION** : All data are up-to-date.

 * **Time out on** device : No data coming in for this device since 90 seconds

This time out limit value can be edited in *myqgroupbox.py*

Alarms
======

.. image:: _static/alarm.png

These buttons are showing alarms on criticals devices when unexpected value are reached :


 * Ion gauge pressure < 1e-4 Torr

 * Turbo speed < 90000 RPM

 * Gatevalve closed

 * Cooler power < 70 W or > 245 W.


These threshold values can be modified in *window.py*

You can click also click on each button to get more details.


Configuration
*************

This software has been made to be dynamic, it relies on an editable configuration file *curve_config.cfg*.

This file is located in ics_sps_engineering_monitorData/config

In the database, the archiver follows always the same structure :

One table per device and one field per keyword.

Let's take a device as an example : *The Cooler* which has four keywords : setpoint, reject, tip, power

 .. image:: _static/config_monitor.png

 * **[xcu_r1__coolertemps]** : [the tablename in your database]

 * **label_device** : it will be the name of the Box
 * **keyword** : fieldnames in your database *(separated with coma)*
 * **label** : name of your curves *(separated with coma)*
 * **lower_bound** : minimum  acceptable value *(separated with coma)*
 * **higher_bound** : maximum acceptable value *(separated with coma)*


Functionalities
***************

.. image:: _static/monitor_main.png


All devices are sorted in boxes containing its timestamp and keywords.

Each keyword is represented by a two states label which evolves according to the current value :

 * Green : Value is within the boundaries

 * Red : Value is outside the boundaries


Toolbar
=======

You can find two functions on the upper toolbar

* **extract to CSV** : Extract device data within specified date
* **export to Wiki** : ...
