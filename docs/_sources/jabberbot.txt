Alarm
=====

You can subscribe/unsubscribe to the Alarm by sending *Alarm_on/Alarm_off*

There are four types of alarms :

 * Ion gauge pressure < 1e-4 Torr

 * Turbo speed < 90000 RPM

 * Gatevalve closed

 * Cooler power < 70 W or > 245 W.

If an Alarm is activated :

Alarm's subscribers will received every minutes an alert message until someone sends an acknowledgement message :

 **alarm_ack** *pressure|turbo|gatevalve|cooler*

Then when the problem is fixed, the alarm can be rearmed by sending :

 **alarm_rearm** *pressure|turbo|gatevalve|cooler*

Troubleshooting
***************

I experienced some trouble to launch the Bot on Fedora.

I found the patch on this link.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/master/net-im/py-XMPPpy/files/patch-XMPP-transports.py

I made the change on */usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/XMPP/transport.py* and it worked.
